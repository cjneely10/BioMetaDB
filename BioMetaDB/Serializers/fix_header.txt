@   .fix file structure identifies issues in your project and displays them as:
@
@       ISSUE
@       <DATA_TYPE>:    <ID>
@       <ISSUE_TYPE>  <FIX_TYPE>
@       ---
@   Note that all .fix files are tab delimited
@
@
@ Depending on the issues identified, your .fix file may contain the following:
@
@       PROJECT:    <PROJECT_NAME>
@       INVALID_PATH    NONE
@
@
@       RECORD:    <RECORD_ID>:  <TABLE_NAME>
@       BAD_TYPE    NONE
@
@       RECORD:    <RECORD_ID>:  <TABLE_NAME>
@       BAD_LOCATION    DELETE
@
@
@       FILE:    <FILE_ID>:  <TABLE_NAME>
@       BAD_RECORD    NONE
@
@       Each issue is defined as:
@
@       PROJECT INVALID_PATH:   working_dir path stored in config file is invalid
@       RECORD  BAD_TYPE:       data type for record could not be determined
@       RECORD  BAD_LOCATION:       stored file path for record does not exist
@       FILE    BAD_RECORD:     file exists in project directory with no assigned database id
@
@   For each issue, default actions are presented. The following fixes are available:
@
@       PROJECT:    <PROJECT_NAME>
@       INVALID_PATH    PATH    /path/to/project_directory
@
@
@       RECORD:    <RECORD_ID>: <TABLE_NAME>
@       BAD_TYPE    SET     data_type(e.g. fasta/fastq)
@
@       RECORD:    <RECORD_ID>: <TABLE_NAME>
@       BAD_LOCATION    FILE    /path/to/data_file.fna
@
@
@       FILE:    <FILE_ID>: <TABLE_NAME>
@       BAD_RECORD    RECORD    record_id_in_database
@
@   If you do not wish to fix a particular issue, simple delete the entire entry,
@   starting from "ISSUE" until "---"
@
@   Do NOT add additional characters, newline or otherwise
